ghost-free HDR merging software

REQUIREMENTS - g++, cmake, make, openCV 3.4.1 (tested, should work with > 3.0)
	LuminanceHDR for opening HDR results in .exr (http://qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net/)

Build application - run script "build.sh"

Folder "images" contains author's HDR sets and selected sets from Tursun and Karaduzovic datasets. To merge them into HDR, run one of the following scripts:
    merge_bmw_x5.sh  merge_fabia.sh  merge_Karaduzovic_set1.sh  merge_Karaduzovic_set3.sh  merge_sandero.sh  merge_Tursun_FastCars.sh  merge_Tursun_Shop2.sh

Results of HDR merging with and without proposed ghost-free merging algorithm are in folder "results", so as certainty maps for individual input images.
The reference image is fixed to middle image in the sequence
